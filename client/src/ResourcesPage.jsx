        <h1 className="title"> Hypothyroidism</h1>
        <h2 className="heading">What is hypothyroidism?</h2>
        <p>Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid disease) is a condition that happens when your thyroid gland doesn’t make or release enough hormone into your bloodstream. As a result, your metabolism slows down. This can cause unintentional weight gain and make you feel exhausted all the time.</p>
        <p>Although weight gain and fatigue aren’t specific to hypothyroidism, a simple blood test can help your healthcare provider check for this condition.</p>
        <p>In general, hypothyroidism is very treatable. Most people can manage the condition with medication and regular follow-up visits with their endocrinologist.</p>
        <p>Left untreated over long periods of time, hypothyroidism can become life-threatening. If you develop new symptoms, it’s important to get an evaluation.</p>
        <h2 className="heading">How is hypothyroidism treated?</h2>
        <p>The most common hypothyroidism treatment is hormone replacement therapy. Levothyroxine (Synthroid®, Levo-T®) is a medication that replaces the hormones that your thyroid can’t make naturally. Most people take it in the morning on an empty stomach. Taken daily, levothyroxine can even out your hormone levels and eliminate your symptoms.</p>
        <p>It’ll take a bit of trial and error to find the right dosage. To do this, your provider will run routine thyroid blood tests until your TSH levels even out.</p>
        <p>You’ll need to take hypothyroidism medication for the rest of your life. With careful management and regular follow-ups with your healthcare provider, you can lead a normal and healthy life.</p>
        <h1 className="title"> Hyperthyroidism</h1>
        <h2 className="heading">What is hyperthyroidism?</h2>
        <p>Hyperthyroidism, also called overactive thyroid, is a condition where your thyroid makes and releases high levels of thyroid hormone. It has multiple possible causes. The main thyroid hormones are triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).</p>
        <p>Hyperthyroidism speeds up your metabolism, which can affect several aspects of your health. The condition can throw your whole well-being off balance. You may not feel like yourself or even feel out of control of your body. It’s important to get medical treatment if you develop signs of hyperthyroidism so you can get back to feeling like yourself.</p>
        <h2 className="heading">What is the treatment for hyperthyroidism?</h2>
        <p>There are many treatment options for hyperthyroidism. Depending on the cause, some options may be better for you than others. Your healthcare provider will discuss each option with you and help you determine the best treatment plan.</p>
        <p>Methimazole (Tapazole®) and propylthiouracil (PTU) block the ability of your thyroid to make hormones. These medications are the most common treatment for hyperthyroidism. They can usually control thyroid function within two to three months. Your symptoms may get better within days to weeks.</p>
        <p>RAI therapy involves taking radioactive iodine by mouth in a single capsule or liquid dose. The radioactive iodine targets your thyroid cells specifically and destroys them. RAI usually leads to permanent destruction of your thyroid, which will cure hyperthyroidism. Most people who receive this treatment must take thyroid hormone medication (levothyroxine) for the rest of their lives to maintain normal thyroid hormone levels.</p>
        <p>A surgeon may remove all or part of your thyroid gland through surgery (thyroidectomy). This will correct hyperthyroidism but will usually cause hypothyroidism, requiring lifelong thyroid hormone medication.</p>
        <p>Beta-blockers are medications that can help manage hyperthyroidism symptoms like rapid heartbeat, nervousness and shakiness. But they don’t change the level of hormones in your blood. Your provider may recommend beta-blockers alongside another treatment.</p>
        <p>Each of these treatments has specific side effects and risks. Your provider will go over them with you. Don’t hesitate to ask questions.</p>
